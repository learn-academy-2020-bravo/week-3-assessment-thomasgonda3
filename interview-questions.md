# ASSESSMENT 3: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions. First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory. Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn.

1. What is object destructuring?

  Your answer:  renaming a variable in a simpler form when taken from a different part of the project

  Researched answer:  Destructuring on objects lets you bind variables to different properties of an object. You specify the property being bound, followed by the variable you are binding its value to.



2. What are the three arguments that .map() and .filter() can accept?

  Your answer: the current value, the current index, and the array as a whole

  Researched answer: the current value, the current index, and the array as a whole



3. What is the difference between a class and an object?

  Your answer: classes are blueprints of an object and dont actually exist themselves until a one is created.  Objects are instances of whatever is being declared.  They actually exist within the program.

  Researched answer:  Classes and objects from the essential part of Object-oriented programming, where a class can be considered as a construct that encapsulates a group of variables and methods; whereas, an object acts as member or instance of that class. A class is a blueprint from which you can create the instance, i.e., objects



4. What is the difference between a HTML div and a span?

  Your answer: A div is a divider that keeps track of whatever you want to be in the block of code so that you can style it however you like, I don't know what a span is.

  Researched answer: The difference between span and div is that a span element is in-line and usually used for a small chunk of HTML inside a line (such as inside a paragraph) whereas a div (division) element is block-line (which is basically equivalent to having a line-break before and after it) and used to group larger chunks of code.



5. What is React.Fragment and why would you want to use it?

  Your answer:  It's a divider used within our render method within react that tells the program exactly what it wants to display on the page.

  Researched answer:  A common pattern in React is for a component to return multiple elements. Fragments let you group a list of children without adding extra nodes to the DOM.



6. What are three options for creating responsive design?

  Your answer:  I don't know.

  Researched answer:  The first was the idea of fluid grids, and the second technique was the idea of fluid images. Using a very simple technique of setting the max-width property to 100%, images would scale down smaller if their containing column became narrower than the image's intrinsic size, but never grow larger. This enables an image to scale down to fit in a flexibly-sized column, rather than overflow it, but not grow larger and become pixellated if the column becomes wider than the image. The third key component was the media query. Media Queries enable the type of layout switch that Cameron Adams had previously explored using JavaScript, using only CSS. Rather than having one layout for all screen sizes, the layout could be changed. Sidebars could be repositioned for the smaller screen, or alternate navigation could be displayed.


## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week
- Object oriented programming - Object-oriented programming (OOP) refers to a type of computer programming (software design) in which programmers define the data type of a data structure, and also the types of operations (functions) that can be applied to the data structure.
- irb - Interactive Ruby Shell (IRB or irb) is a REPL for programming in the object-oriented scripting language Ruby. The abbreviation irb is a portmanteau of the word "interactive" and the filename extension for Ruby files, ".rb".
- Instance variable - In object-oriented programming with classes, an instance variable is a variable defined in a class (i.e. a member variable), for which each instantiated object of the class has a separate copy, or instance. An instance variable is similar to a class variable.
- Ruby hash - In Ruby you can create a Hash by assigning a key to a value with =>, separate these key/value pairs with commas, and enclose the whole thing with curly braces.
- Class relationships - Object oriented programming generally support 4 types of relationships that are: inheritance , association, composition and aggregation. All these relationship is based on "is a" relationship, "has-a" relationship and "part-of" relationship.
- Getter and Setter methods in Ruby - Then, in that case, we use the getter and setter methods. these methods allow us to access a classâ€™s instance variable from outside the class. Getter methods are used to get the value of an instance variable while the setter methods are used to set the value of an instance variable of some class.
